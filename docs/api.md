Welcome to the Analogue API. You can use this public API to access and modify your data on [Analogue](https://analogue.app).

### Examples

We've build our apps on top of this same API:

- [Analogue Alfred Powerpack](https://www.analogue.app/alfred)
- [Analogue Browser Extension](https://www.analogue.app/extension)

### API Root URL

The Analogue API is organized following [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) standards. All requests return properly-formatted [JSON](https://www.json.org/).
